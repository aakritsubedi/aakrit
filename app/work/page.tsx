          </h1>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            After completing my undergraduate studies, I began my career as a
            Software Engineer at Leapfrog Technology, where I spent over two
            years building ed-tech and health-tech web and mobile applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            I then joined Naamche Inc., as software engineer. Initially, I
            helped build some of the products for reAlpha. I currently work as a
            Engineering Manager, guiding teams and overseeing the development of
            multiple client and internal projects and also involved on active
            development across the multiple products.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Alongside my professional roles, I actively work on personal
            projects and occasionally take on freelance work for both national
            and international clients, allowing me to explore new technologies
            and deliver impactful solutions across diverse domains.
