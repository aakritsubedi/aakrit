        I'm always exploring the latest in tech—whether it's new frameworks,
        tools, or breakthroughs in software development. I love diving deep,
        understanding how things work, and turning complex concepts into
        actionable insights. Sharing these discoveries at events and meetups
        energizes me, as I believe collective growth is fueled by
        knowledge-sharing and open discussion.
